## Problem Statement:
The facility location optimization problem involves finding the best locations for a set of facilities to meet the demand of a given set of customers. The goal is to minimize the total cost of transportation while ensuring that customer demands are satisfied and facility capacities are not exceeded.

## Features:
1. Defines facility locations as binary decision variables.
2. Assigns customers to facilities based on binary decision variables.
3. Considers distances between facilities and customers.
4. Enforces customer demand satisfaction and facility capacity constraints.
5. Uses the Gurobi solver for optimization.

## Results
The code displays the optimal facility locations and customer assignments based on the solved optimization problem.
